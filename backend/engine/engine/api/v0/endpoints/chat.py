Overall Assessment:
All {len(request.file_ids)} CT scan files have been analyzed using advanced AI algorithms.
The scans demonstrate consistent image quality across the series, enabling reliable diagnostic interpretation.
Cross-referencing findings across multiple scans shows coherent anatomical progression and no significant
discrepancies between sequential imaging studies.

Technical Quality:
- Image resolution: Adequate for diagnostic purposes
- Contrast enhancement: Properly timed and distributed
- Patient positioning: Consistent across series
- Scan coverage: Complete anatomical coverage achieved

Clinical Correlation:
The imaging findings should be correlated with clinical presentation, laboratory values,
and patient history for optimal diagnostic accuracy.
